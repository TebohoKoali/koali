  <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
  <p>In the world of chess, Chessride Comapny began as a small pawn shop in the heart of a bustling chess community. Our founder, Mr. Koali, a passionate chess player and        
   enterpreneur, saw an opportunity to create a unique space where players of all levels could come together to share their love for the game. With dedication and hardwork, our humble pawn 
   shop evolved into a thriving chess business that offers not only a wide selection of chess sets and accessories but also hosts tournaments and provides lessons.</p>
